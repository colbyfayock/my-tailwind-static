    Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done
    anything at all.
  </h1>

  <p>
    Bender, quit destroying the universe! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. I never loved you. Moving along…
    Belligerent and numerous.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then the battle's not so bad? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Five hours? Aw, man! <strong> Couldn't
    you just get me the death penalty?</strong> <em>Daylight and everything.</em> She also liked to shut up!
  </p>

  <h2>Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</h2>
  <p>
    Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. I suppose I could part with 'one'
    and still be feared… You know, I was God once. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us
    trust you?
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>With gusto.</li>
    <li>Soon enough.</li>
    <li>Hello Morbo, how's the family?</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Oh God, what have I done?</h3>

  <p>
    Yeah, lots of people did. Why would I want to know that? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…
    Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To
    shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>You lived before you met me?!</li>
    <li>Throw her in the brig.</li>
    <li>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." No! I want to
    live! There are still too many things I don't own! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the
    known universe!
  </p>

  <p>
    No argument here. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? And I'm his friend Jesus. What kind of a father
    would I be if I said no? Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that
    panders to my lust for violence?
  </p>

  <p>
    Is that a cooking show? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is
    intelligent. Dissect its brain! Why did you bring us here? Bender, we're trying our best.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done
    anything at all. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start
    cracking wise about our mamas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence
    never solved anything. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm
    transferring to business school!
  </p>

  <p>
    You wouldn't. Ask anyway! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a
    12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess
    you caused.
  </p>

  <p>
    Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese
    wodies. Shut up and get to the point! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the
    web that panders to my lust for violence?
  </p>

  <p>
    I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Also Zoidberg. Hey, guess what you're
    accessories to. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
  </p>

  <p>
    It's a T. It goes "tuh". Bender?! You stole the atom. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. I daresay that Fry has
    discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.
  </p>

  <p>
    Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Okay, I like a challenge. One hundred
    dollars. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Meh. I'm Santa Claus!
  </p>

  <p>
    It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Please, Don-Bot… look
    into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip
    Clubs while we're at it?
